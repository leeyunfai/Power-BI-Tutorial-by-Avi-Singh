# Power-BI-Tutorial-by-Avi-Singh

This project was done following the YouTube video tutorial uploaded by Avi Singh - Power BI Tutorial From Beginner to Pro ⚡ Desktop to Dashboard in 60 Minutes ⏰ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGrl-H87pRU). 
The pdf attached shows the dashboard created at the end of the course. 
I went through this course as an introduction to Power BI, in the span of 1 hour which I have found to be rather useful.
